You see how passing NULL in place of method parameters are defying you read your tests the way you want?  They’re hampering out identifying what the NULL parameter actually is, because without looking further into your code (or inspecting using your IDE facilities), you cannot make sure what the type of the argument it really is.<br /><br />You need to reveal your intentions.  Every programmer who will look at your test code in the future, will get the some troubles to understand what a NULL in the middle of the test code means, because you didn’t make it clear to them.<br /><br />Think over what would be a variable of type User, whose initial value is NULL, and is expected in place of an method called GetLoggedInUser?  Hey, I know that!  If you’ve worked professionally as a software developer for a brief time at least, you may have heard people talking about Guest or Anonymous users, referring to them as they were any user who is not identified by the system in a given moment in time.  Go ahead and introduce this concept as a constant, make clear for your colleagues who will read your unit tests, really expecting they will help them out.<br /><br />Repeat the same process for every NULL or object initialisation in your code.

And later we'll come back and give it a try.<br /><br />f you chose to write an override method that changes the behaviour of TripDAO.FindTripsByUser(user), according to your expectations in a test case, you'll want to write a method that returns the user's trips, being the user the one you passed as a parameter to the GetTripsByUser method.  You should avoid to use a mock object, and that's a good example of where you should not use a mock.  Instead use a real objects, of class User, as they will not change the behaviour of your tests, nor your production code.  The real object will facilitate other developers to familiarise with the API they shall use, including the objects classes they use to interact with your service.<br /><br />Pay much attention on whether you might be abusing of Mock objects, as in most of the cases, they'll not be needed, therefore they only add unnecessary complexity to your test code.

Scrolling is also a given when viewing content on a smartphone so any page which is structured with this in mind will help make the design and its navigation feel well thought through for mobile. Clustering related content within a single page should definitely reduce the need to navigate to a different page, as well as that repetitive ‘Click next to continue’ instruction as well.<br><br>Of course, we should always try to gain the learners attention early on the page, it’s just that now, when we have it, we aren’t asking them to go somewhere else. The design challenge is now to give them a reason to scroll and venture down ‘below the fold’.  To continue close this tutor pop-up."
